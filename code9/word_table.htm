<!--	word_table.php
        
        Uses a function to split a given string of text into

        its constituant words. It also determines the frequency of

        occurrence of each word. The words are separated by whitespace

        or punctuation, possibly followed by whitespace. The

        punctuation can be a period, a comma, a semicolon, a colon,

        an exclamation point, or a questionmark.
 
        The main driver program calls the function and displays

        the results.
