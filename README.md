# CS_3010_Web_Development

As the title indicates, this is my collection of materials from CS 3010 which is a basic web development class.  
Currently, the structure is a mess, but to explain:  
Text_Presentations contains the class powerpoint slide decks  
code# folders contain a progression of work and examples  
projects_quizzes_test_hw contains each of those items in the folder name.  It is the one that needs cleaned up the most.
